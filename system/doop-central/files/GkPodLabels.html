<p>This check validates required labels on Pods.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    Each Pod should have a <code>ccloud/support-group</code> label containing the name of the support group
    that is responsible for it. Optionally, the <code>ccloud/service</code> label can be added to further route alerts
    within the support group. These labels will be used for routing generic pod alerts.

    Please refer to <a href="https://operations.global.cloud.sap/docs/support/operation_model/tags/">the operations documentation</a>
    for more details on the labels that drive our support process.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Add the missing labels, as reported. Usually you do not have to maintain labels on individual pod specs. They will
    be added automatically if you have <a href="https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/common/owner-info">owner-info</a>
    defined on the level of the Helm chart.
